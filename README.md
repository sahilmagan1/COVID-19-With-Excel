# COVID-19-With-Excel

This project is a case study of researching the prevalence of diabetes related deaths due to COVID-19. We begin by retreiving the data from the CDC's website, cleaning it, analyzing it using variance and multiple charts, and creating a report for our findings. 

## Prerequisites

Download the zip from the following link : https://github.com/sahilmagan1/COVID-19-With-Excel.git

The latest version of this dataset can also be found here : https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/covid-19-mortality-data-files.htm

### Installing

Extract the file to your local repository, and and continuously push commits to remote repository to keep track of changes made. Open the file in Microsoft Excel. Save a new file and rename to **"Diabetes and COVID19 v1"**.

## Analysis

### Cleaning The Data

1. Begin cleaning the data by creating data tables and filling blank rows. Reformat dates and values to observe the entire table.
2. Check for duplicates.
3. Create a new sheet labeled *"COVID19 By Month"* for COVID-19 Deaths grouped by months as we would like to see the trend of diabetes related deaths over time.
4. Delete the original sheet labeled *"COVID19 Deaths With Conditions"*. 
5. Save a new file renamed to **"Diabetes and COVID19 v2"**. This will reduce the size of the document significantly, and will make loading times quicker. 

### Pivot Tables

1. Save a new file and rename to **"Diabetes and COVID19 v3"**. 
2. TBD
3. Use Forecasting and Variance to conduct analysis.
4. Pressure test to confirm analysis.

### Presentation

1. Save a new file and rename to **"Diabetes and COVID19 v4"**.
2. TBD
3. TBD
4. TBD
5. Reformat and provide key findings at the bottom of table.
